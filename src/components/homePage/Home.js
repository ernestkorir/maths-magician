      The arithmometer was the first commercially successful calculating machine to complete all four
      basic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication and division — according to IBM.
      Like Hahn, Thomas also based his calculator on the stepped drum mechanism of Leibniz.
      The machine featured a second result display for subtraction and division as well as a
      multiplication gear.

      The IBM 608 was the first calculating machine to use solid-state transistors instead of
      vacuum tubes. The machine was housed in several large cabinets.
      According to the company’s website,
      customers could purchase the machine for $83, 210 (or rent it for $1,760 a month).
      The machine’s main memory could store 40 nine-digit numbers and
      could perform 4,500 additions per second, among other operations.
